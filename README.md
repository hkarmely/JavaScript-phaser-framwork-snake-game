Project Reflection:
--------------------
This Game is a nice pratice for JavaScript phaser framework, 
JavaScript Flow Control, 
JavaScript Arrys handling and methods, 
And more

This Game could actually be written in pure Javascript, 

In this games case, 
Phaser framwork provies the peload, create and update functions, 
which are a logic architecture for game development, 
the update function could be replaced by setInterval and repeat JavaScript functions, 
and preload and create could be replaced by regular and OOP JavaScript Functions. 

Overall the Phaser Framework experience was nice, 
Esspecially with <script></script> import, that enabled my 
to encapsulate all the code in one HTML file, 
instead of deploying a node/express server.
